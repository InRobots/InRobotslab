# Open positions

**Note: We currently don't have funding for additional postdoc positions. We can only welcome you if you have a fellowship. I'd be happy to support you after you apply to our group. 

We are always looking for new group members with passion, talent, and grit!


### Master projects
If you are interested in pursuing a Master degree at JLU, see [masterscust.oe](http://gd.cust.edu.cn/yjsyxk/yjszs/66543.htm#maker). We take master students if we get exceptional applicants (this usually means very good grades).
### Bsc students for JLU students 
If you are a Bsc student at CUST looking for a Bsc opening project, contact me (or any group member) per email or stop by my office.
