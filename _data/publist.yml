- title: "Autonomous rock detection on mars through region contrast"
  image: rc.png
  description: In this paper, we present a new autonomous rock detection approach through region contrast. New method deals with this issue in region level, which will significantly reduce the computational cost. Only low-level features are measured and a more reliable method is further proposed by introducing spatial factor and background similarity to the region contrast.

- title: "Safe Mars landing strategy: Towards lidar-based high altitude hazard detection"
  image: twostage.png
  description: This paper presents a high altitude hazard detection method for Mars landing. Towards safe landing requirements for future missions, hazard detection should be triggered as soon as possible. We therefore proposed a lidar based high altitude hazard detection approach, consisting of two main procedures, Terrain reconstruction and Hazard mapping. An interpolation based terrain reconstruction algorithm is proposed to model the datum surface of landing region.

- title: "Auto rock detection via sparse-based background modeling for mars rover"
  image: 5dof.png
  description: We propose a novel auto rock detection scheme via sparse based background modeling for planetary rover. Instead of pixel level image processing and pre training, we deal with the detection issue by region contrast enhancement. Our method consists of a rough detection algorithm to auto-label conservative background regions and a background modeling algorithm to precisely detect rocks. Background is reconstructed in feature space with the labeled regions as dictionary via sparse representation. Contrast map is enhanced by the error of original image and reconstructed background. Afterwards, rock is directly segmented by an auto threshold.
