- title: "A reconfiguration strategy for modular robots using origami folding"
  image: dummy.png
  description: "Reconfigurability in versatile systems of modular robots is achieved by changing the morphology of the overall structure as well as by connecting and disconnecting modules. Recurrent connectivity changes can cause misalignment that leads to mechanical failure of the system. This paper presents a new approach to reconfiguration, inspired by the art of origami, that eliminates connectivity changes during transformation. Our method consists of an energy-optimal reconfiguration planner that generates an initial 2D assembly pattern and an actuation sequence of the modular units, both resulting in minimum energy consumption. The algorithmic framework includes two approaches, an automatic modeling algorithm as well as a heuristic algorithm. We further demonstrate the effectiveness of our method by applying the algorithms to Mori, a modular origami robot, in simulation. Our results show that the heuristic algorithm yields reconfiguration schemes with high quality, compared with the automatic modeling algorithm, simultaneously saving a considerable amount of computational time and effort."

- title: "A Kernel-Based Multi-Featured Rock Modeling and Detection Framework for a Mars Rover"
  image: dummy.png
  description: "This article presents two kernel-based rock detection methods for a Mars rover. Rock detection on planetary surfaces is particularly pivotal for planetary vehicles regarding navigation and obstacle avoidance. However, the diverse morphologies of Martian rocks, the sparsity of pixel-wise features, and engineering constraints are great challenges to current pixel-wise object detection methods, resulting in inaccurate and delayed object location and recognition. We therefore propose a region-wise rock detection framework and design two detection algorithms, kernel principle component analysis (KPCA)-based rock detection (KPRD) and kernel low-rank representation (KLRR)-based rock detection (KLRD), using hypotheses of feature and sub-spatial separability. KPRD is based on KPCA and is expert in real-time detection yet with less accurate performance. KLRD is based on KPRD with KLRR which can generate more precise rock detection results with less delay. To validate the efficiency of the proposed methods, we build a small-scale Martian rock dataset, MarsData, containing various rocks. Preliminary experimental results show that our methods are efficient in dealing with complex images containing rocks, shadows, and gravel. The code and data are available at: https://github.com/CVIR-Lab/MarsData."

  image: 5dof.png
  description: We propose a novel auto rock detection scheme via sparse based background modeling for planetary rover. Instead of pixel level image processing and pre training, we deal with the detection issue by region contrast enhancement. Our method consists of a rough detection algorithm to auto-label conservative background regions and a background modeling algorithm to precisely detect rocks. Background is reconstructed in feature space with the labeled regions as dictionary via sparse representation. Contrast map is enhanced by the error of original image and reconstructed background. Afterwards, rock is directly segmented by an auto threshold.
