- title: "RockFormer: A U-Shaped Transformer Network for Martian Rock Segmentation"
  image: rockformer.png
  description: "We propose RockFormer, the first U-shaped Transformer framework for Mars rock segmentation, consisting of a hierarchical encoder–decoder architecture with a feature refining module (FRM) connected between them. Specifically, the encoder hierarchically generates multiscale features using an improved vision Transformer (improved-ViT), where both abundant local information and long-range contexts are exploited. The FRM removes less representative features and captures global dependencies between multiscale features, improving RockFormer’s robustness to Martian rocks with diverse appearances. The decoder is responsible for aggregating these features for pixelwise rock prediction. For evaluation, we establish two Mars rock datasets, including both real and synthesized images. One is MarsData-V2, an extension of our previously published MarsData collected from real Mars rocks. The other is SynMars, a synthetic dataset sequentially photographed from a virtual terrain built referring to the TianWen-1 dataset. Extensive experiments on the two datasets show the superiority of RockFormer for Martian rock segmentation, achieving state-of-the-art performance with decent computational simplicity."

- title: "A reconfiguration strategy for modular robots using origami folding"
  image: ijrr.png
  description: "Reconfigurability in versatile systems of modular robots is achieved by changing the morphology of the overall structure as well as by connecting and disconnecting modules. Recurrent connectivity changes can cause misalignment that leads to mechanical failure of the system. This paper presents a new approach to reconfiguration, inspired by the art of origami, that eliminates connectivity changes during transformation. Our method consists of an energy-optimal reconfiguration planner that generates an initial 2D assembly pattern and an actuation sequence of the modular units, both resulting in minimum energy consumption. The algorithmic framework includes two approaches, an automatic modeling algorithm as well as a heuristic algorithm. We further demonstrate the effectiveness of our method by applying the algorithms to Mori, a modular origami robot, in simulation. Our results show that the heuristic algorithm yields reconfiguration schemes with high quality, compared with the automatic modeling algorithm, simultaneously saving a considerable amount of computational time and effort."

- title: "DC-MOT: Motion Deblurring and Compensation for Multi-Object Tracking in UAV Videos"
  image: icra2023model.jpg
  description: "We propose a multi-object tracking framework for videos captured by UAVs, considering motion imperfection in the following two aspects: 1) motion blurring of objects due to high-speed motion of the UAV and the objects,deteriorating the performance of the detector; 2) motion coupling
of the global movement of the UAV camera with the object motion, resulting in the nonlinearity of objects trajectories in adjacent frames and further more difficult to predict. For motion blurring, this paper proposes a hybrid deblurring module
that deals with the blurred frames while retaining the clear frames, trading off between video tracking performance and spatio-temporal consistency. For motion coupling, we proposed a motion compensation module to align adjacent frames by
feature matching, and the corrected target position is obtained in the next frame to alleviate the interference of camera movement with tracking. We evaluate the proposed methods on VisDrone dataset and validate that our framework achieves
new state-of-the-art performance on UAV-based MOT systems."

- title: "Co-optimization of Morphology and Behavior of Modular Robots via Hierarchical Deep Reinforcement Learning"
  image: modular_robot.png
  description: "Modular robots hold the promise of changing their shape and even dimension to adapt to various tasks and environments. To realize this superiority, it is essential to find the appropriate morphology and its corresponding behavior simultaneously to ensure optimality of the reconfiguration. However, achieving co-optimization is challenging because robotic configuration and motion are interactive and coupled with each other, as well as their optimization processes. To this end, we proposed a co-optimization framework based on hierarchical Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL), consisting of a configuration model and a motion model based on the Twin Delayed Deep Deterministic policy gradient algorithm (TD3). The two network models update asynchronously with a shared reward to ensure co-optimality. We conduct simulations and experiments with the Webots platform to validate the proposed framework, and the preliminary results show that it yields high quality optimization schemes and thus allows modular robots to be more adaptive to dynamic and multi-task scenarios."

- title: "A Kernel-Based Multi-Featured Rock Modeling and Detection Framework for a Mars Rover"
  image: tnnls1.jpg
  description: "This article presents two kernel-based rock detection methods for a Mars rover. Rock detection on planetary surfaces is particularly pivotal for planetary vehicles regarding navigation and obstacle avoidance. However, the diverse morphologies of Martian rocks, the sparsity of pixel-wise features, and engineering constraints are great challenges to current pixel-wise object detection methods, resulting in inaccurate and delayed object location and recognition. We therefore propose a region-wise rock detection framework and design two detection algorithms, kernel principle component analysis (KPCA)-based rock detection (KPRD) and kernel low-rank representation (KLRR)-based rock detection (KLRD), using hypotheses of feature and sub-spatial separability. KPRD is based on KPCA and is expert in real-time detection yet with less accurate performance. KLRD is based on KPRD with KLRR which can generate more precise rock detection results with less delay. To validate the efficiency of the proposed methods, we build a small-scale Martian rock dataset, MarsData, containing various rocks. Preliminary experimental results show that our methods are efficient in dealing with complex images containing rocks, shadows, and gravel. The code and data are available at: https://github.com/CVIR-Lab/MarsData."

  description: We propose a novel auto rock detection scheme via sparse based background modeling for planetary rover. Instead of pixel level image processing and pre training, we deal with the detection issue by region contrast enhancement. Our method consists of a rough detection algorithm to auto-label conservative background regions and a background modeling algorithm to precisely detect rocks. Background is reconstructed in feature space with the labeled regions as dictionary via sparse representation. Contrast map is enhanced by the error of original image and reconstructed background. Afterwards, rock is directly segmented by an auto threshold.
